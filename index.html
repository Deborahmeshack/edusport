			<h1> I'm <span>Deborah <br></span>a Frontend Developer
			</h1>
			<p>i decided to venture into web developement last year as i believe it will be my rescue out of financial instability and unemloyement,  starting wasn't easy as i do not have a laptop of myself,  i decided to make do with what i have, so i started learning with my phone; the aim was to be a fullstack developer but later on i came to find out that i can't use my phone to learn backend developemt so i decided to stick to frontend developement for the main time, youtube, w3school and frontend tutor were the platform i was using to learn.</p>

	 		<p>At first i was okay learning from my device but later on i became so uncomfortable with it because i saw alot of things i coudn't do or achieve with my device as it's just a portrait device and not a tablet, i was determined to breakout of unemployement and finanicial instability so i decided to dedicate the whole of last year to learning the principle of good user interface (ui), coloring and positioning using my phone, i would learn and practice from my phone, then sometimes when i get access to laptop i try applying it to see how it look and view and on big screen, i mostly make use of my friends laptop who work as an HR at one real estate company, coming across edustipend i decided to designed this one page portfolio website to showcase little of what i learned last year and as one of my prove to edustipend on how much having my personal laptop will improve my growth and set me on a part of excellence and ready made to begin job hunt and freelancing, i designed this using my friends laptop</p>
